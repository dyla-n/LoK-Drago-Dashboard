TO MAKE IT WORK:

You must set up localhost for it to work. To do so if you don't know how:

Open IIS (Internet Information Service Manager) > right click Add Website > name the site whatever > select the physical path to the folder the files are stored in > start the site > click browse/pull up localhost
