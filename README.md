Follow the instructions here to setup an alchemy api key:

https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/alchemy-quickstart-guide#1key-create-an-alchemy-key

Put your API key into the pants.js file where it says to put it... make sure you do the https: version (it looks like this https://matic-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/ ---- YOUR API KEY ---- ). You can do this in notepad or whatever you want to open the file in to edit it. I like notepad++ https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

index.html must be set up as localhost for it to work. if you don't know how:

Open IIS (Internet Information Service Manager) > right click Add Website > name the site whatever > select the physical path to the folder the files are stored in > start the site > click browse/pull up localhost

the first time you open localhost you will need to connect your wallet.  refresh the page if it doesnt start loading stuff. After that you won't need to connect it will do it automatically on opening.

make sure to send me things to compensate me for all my hard work ;) 0x9bbA112eaD944eEE1Aa90546Ce64fE7693b5Cf74
